# vertojs

Verto (VER-to) RTC is a FreeSWITCH endpoint that implements a subset of a JSON-RPC connection designed for use over secure websockets. The initial target is WebRTC to simplify coding and implementing calls from web browsers and devices to FreeSWITCH. This allows a web browser or other WebRTC client to originate a call using Verto into a FreeSWITCH installation and then out to the PSTN using SIP, SS7, or other supported protocol.
